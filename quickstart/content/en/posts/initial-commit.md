This is my first blog post, a test to make sure I've set this up correctly and can start learning how to make new posts in markdown.

I've been interested in the idea of making a website for a while now. Recently, I came across a YouTube video by Chris Titus where he shows his workflow for making blogposts on his blog using Netlify to host his static Hugo site. 

It's free to host a static site with Netlify for up to 100GB of data transferal so I bought my name as a domain for the site from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and picked a theme with the help of my friend Matt from the [Hugo themes repository](https://themes.gohugo.io/).

Also because I dreaded the idea of trying to transcode the current time/day into the format of "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+UTC" I wrote a simple Autohotkey script that reads the current system date/time and copies it to the clipboard. 

This assumes a time zone of UTC+12 (New Zealand's time zone outside of daylight savings hours) and is available [here.](https://github.com/lpsteentjes/date-to-clipboard-for-hugo-UTC12)
