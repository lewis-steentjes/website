So I accidentally found myself buying a Raspberry Pi 400 and now I need something to do with it ðŸ˜…. The current plan is to use NodeJS to create a web app which will allow provide visual updates via webcam, long-term light-level statistics, automated watering and manual watering via web interface.

This weekend I successfully set up an SSH for my RaspberryPi and hosted a webpage which triggered my webcam to take a photo and update the image on the webpage. Later down the line, this will be used in a permanent setup to view plants. 

Next in line, I will use some form of solar cells to analyse light levels and source a pump and hose for misting the plants from a reservoir.
